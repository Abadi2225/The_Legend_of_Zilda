## Known Bugs

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Rope.cs:54` | Rope's charge-trigger currently uses a timer instead of checking Link's actual position along the same axis. |
| `Trap.cs:75` | Trap activation is timer-based, it should instead trigger when Link aligns with the trap on the correct axis. |
| `Trap.cs:121` | Trap movement direction is hardcoded, it should continusly point toward Link's current position. |
| `WallMaster.cs:87, 137` | WallMaster moves in a fixed direction rather than tracking Link's position. |
| `ItemManager.cs:28` | Link uses sword attack animation when using items, should be fixed to use the use item animation. |
| `TimeBomb.cs:28` | Bomb does disappear but there is still no animation of an explosion.

## Design Patterns Used

The project was built around recommended software design patterns to keep the code maintainable across sprints:

### Command Pattern
All keyboard/mouse input is wrapped in `ICommand` objects (`QuitCommand`, `CycleEnemyCommand`, `CycleItemCommand`, `CycleBlockCommand`, `UseItemCommand`, `SetStateCommand`). This decouples input handling from game logic and makes keybinding changes easier.

### State Pattern
Game flow is managed through `IGameState` implementations (`StartScreenState`, `GameplayState`). Link's animation is similar with (`Idle`, `Walking`, `Attacking`), cleanly separating each state's update and draw logic.

### Factory Pattern
`EnemyFactory`, `ItemFactory`, and `MapManager` centralise object creation. Adding a new enemy or item type only requires changes in one place.
