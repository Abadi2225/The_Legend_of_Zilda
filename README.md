## Sprint 4 — New Features

### Inventory System
Link now has an inventory that holds up to three usable items. Items can be used by assigning one to B slot and using `1`.

### Item Pickups
Collectible items are placed in the world. Walking over them triggers a pickup animation and applies their effect immediately:
- **Heart** — Restores 1 heart
- **Fairy** — Fully restores all hearts
- **Gold Rupee** / **Purple Rupee** — Increases Link's ruby count
- **Key, Bow, Map, Compass, etc.** — Collected into the inventory

### Active Item Combat
Throwable/usable items now deal damage to enemies:
| Item | Damage | Behaviour |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Arrow** | 1 | Travels in a straight line; disappears on first enemy hit |
| **Boomerang** | 1 | Travels out and returns; passes through enemies |
| **Bomb** | 2 | Placed in front of Link; explodes after 3 seconds in a 128 × 128 area |
